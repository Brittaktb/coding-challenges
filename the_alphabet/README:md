The Alphabet

We are now going to train our AI:Bot to recite the 26 letters of the Alphabet from A to Z.
To do so we will use the ASCII code which give a unique integer value to each character that appears on your keyboard, including the 26 uppercase letters of the alphabet.

You can for instance try the following code to display the first three letters of the alphabet:

# Using the ASCII code to display letters of the alphabet
print(chr(65))
print(chr(66))
print(chr(67))
 Combine the above code with a For loop to train your AI:Bot to recite the entire alphabet from A (ASCII code 65) to Z (ASCII code 90).
