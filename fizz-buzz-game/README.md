Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word “fizz”, and any number divisible by five with the word “buzz”.

Fizz-Buzz Challenge

For this challenge you need to write a computer program that will display all the numbers between 1 and 100.
For each number divisible by three the computer will display the word “fizz”,
For each number divisible by five the computer will display the word “buzz”,
For each number divisible by three and by five the computer will display the word “fizz-buzz”,
This is what the output will look like:

1
2
Fizz
4

Tip

To find out if a number can be divided by an other number, you will need to check the remainder of the division by using the % sign in Python. For instance:
7 % 3 = 1 because 7 is not divisible by 3.
6 % 3 = 0 because 6 is divisible by 3.
So to check if number1 can be divided by number2, you can check if:
number1 % number2 == 0.
