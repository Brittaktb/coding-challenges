Coding Challenges

We have designed five algorithms (See flowcharts below). Your task is to implement each of these algorithms using Python code.

A stopwatch is used to record the duration of an event as a number of seconds. 
Our stopwatch algorithm will convert/format this number of seconds to calculate and display the matching number of hours, minutes and seconds, knowing that:

1 hour = 3600 seconds
1 minute = 60 seconds
