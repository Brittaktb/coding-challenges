Iterative Sum

Letâ€™s look at the following code that can be used to find the iterative sum for number 5 using the following calculation:

Iterative sum for 5 = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1
#Iterative Sum for number 5
sum = 0
for i in range(1,6): 
   sum = sum + i
print("Iterative Sum for 5 = " + str(sum))
 Your task is to tweak the above code to get the computer to ask for a positive integer value and calculate the iterative sum for this given number.
